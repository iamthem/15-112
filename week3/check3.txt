Be sure to watch the videos very carefully, and not just
skip ahead to the parts required to answer these questions!

Be *very brief* in your answers!  Seriously.  Brief.

2. The full names and andrew id's of your groupmates, if you worked in a group. 
Kunal Jobanputra

3. Dates/times that you watched the videos listed in check3.html (fill this out as you go): 
1923, 1940, 1956, 2006, 2010, 2014, 2021, 2035, 2040, 2043

4. Total time this check required (fill this out when you are done):

5. Strings questions (from the various String videos):

5.1. Why is len('a\nb') equal to 3 and not 4?
Because '\n' is an escape sequence, which has its own ASCII number 

5.2. List a character that is easier to include in a string delimited by double-quotes rather than single-quotes.
Single quotes 

5.3. List each escape sequence mentioned in the video (like \n) and what they mean.
\n -> newline 
\t -> tab character 
\\ -> backslash
\' -> Single quote 
\" -> Double quote
\r -> carriage return 

5.4. What is type(string.digits)?  Why?
It's a string because it's called from a string function, 
so it prints out the numbers as a string.

5.5. For any string s where len(s)>1, is it definitely true that ((s[1:] in s) == True)?
Yes, the slice s[1:] will return the substring from index two until the end of s

5.6. What is the empty string?  What is its type?  What is its length?
An empty string is a string without anything on it. It looks like this: ""
Its type continues to be a string 
Its length is zero

5.7. What is "abcde"[-1]?
"e"

5.8. What is 'abcde'[-1][-1]?  Briefly explain why that works, but 'abcde'[1][1] crashes.
"e"
It works because the it is asking for the last character in 'abcde', which is "e", and subsequently
asking for the last character in "e", which is still "e". It chrashes on the second example because 
"b" does not have a character at index 1.

5.9. Briefly, why did we write the function reverseString in the video, rather than just using s[::-1] in our code?
Because it is much more intuitive than the slicing equivalent

5.10. Briefly, what is the difference between split and splitlines?
Split breaks a given string by a specified delimiter.
Splitlines splits the string at the line boundaries like \n, and \r

5.11. Please be sure to carefully watch the videos and take time
to discuss and reflect on their content, and not just hurry through
and answer all these questions.  The point of this check is not for
you to answer the questions, but for you to learn the material.  So
please take the time to learn the material well.  Ok?
Ok

5.12. Of the first 4 ways we solve isPalindrome, which way do you think
is the worst, and why so?
Solution four is the worst due to inappropriate use of a while loop that makes the 
code 5 times as long as it needs to be 

5.12. What does it mean that Strings are immutable?
Is means that they cannot be changed in place, like lists for instance. 
For instance this will return an error: 
L[1] = 'a' for some string L 

5.13. What is the difference between a string method and a string function?
A string method is called in the format str.method() while a string function is called 
in the format function(str). Methods manipulate or test the string while functions take 
string as inputs in order to do something useful (which could also be a string)

5.14. What is the difference between chr and ord?
ord() and chr() are inverses of each other. They convert 
back and forth between unicode code points and strings

5.15. What is the difference between lower and islower?
lower() returns a copy of the string in lower case 
islower() tells you if there are lower case characters in 
a given string 

5.16. How do you left-align text using the string formatting operator?
using '-' right after the % character and before the integer that determines space

5.17. Why does the Basic File IO example crash if you run it in the browser?
It crashes because it doesn't have access to the local file system. 

That's it!  Carpe diem!
